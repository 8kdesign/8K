Now that the price is back to S$300+, I hope Xiaomi would once again equip the Redmi Note series with a powerful processor. "

I know that an update is coming, but it is weird that older devices already received MIUI 10 and this hasn’t. I would like to see the next Redmi Note device come with the latest version of MIUI out of the box."
